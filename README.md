## Arduino repo for IoT Nano 33

# Integrates DHT 11 temp/humidity sensor with MQTT Broker over local WiFi

Requires access to an MQTT broker

Should use the template for arduino_secrets.template, but not with saved data
Rename file arduino_secrets.h on local repo and include specifics for your
environment (ip address, wifi connection info, MQTT data, sensor name, etc.)
